Tucker Trips — Session Summary (Edited)

Tucker Trips is a travel notebook and planning hub. The build moved from scaffolding to a working MVP with iterative enhancements driven by user feedback. Core choices: Next.js 14 (App Router), MongoDB + Mongoose, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui, and NextAuth (Credentials + JWT sessions).

What’s Implemented:
Auth: Sign up / sign in via NextAuth (credentials). Profile basics; mock email verification planned.

Trips: Full CRUD with per-trip cover, dates, destination, status (future/taken), and visibility (private/shared/link/public).

Itinerary Segments: Structure in place for flight/stay/transport/activity (type-specific fields supported by the enhanced trip form).

Notes & Journal: Basic rich text with tags; image attachments pending.

Dashboard: Sidebar views (Future Trips, My Trips, Shared Trips) + tile layout.

Profile Settings: Edit name, email, and biography.

Live Chat: Real-time chat panel for online planners (basic presence/messages).

Enhanced New Trip Form: Multi-step flow with airline details (name, cost, quality, excursion, star rating), accommodation details (type, URL, excursion, star rating), weather, and overall comment. Star ratings show only for taken (past) trips.

Landing/Auth UI: Polished landing page with hero + CTAs; subtle purple/pink glow on auth/CTA buttons.

Tech Stack & Key Concepts

Next.js 14 (App Router) with server routes.

MongoDB with Mongoose.

NextAuth (JWT) for sessions.

Tailwind + shadcn/ui for UI.

Zod planned for input validation.

bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken for auth internals.

Architecture & Structure

High level: React UI via App Router; API routes talk to MongoDB; auth handled by NextAuth; shared UI via shadcn components.
